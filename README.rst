Benchmarks
==========

A collection of potentially interesting benchmarks on the JVM with a specific focus on the current Scala compiler,
produced with JMH (and `@ktoso`_ 's excellent `sbt-jmh`_ plugin).
Apart from simply showing benchmark results this project is also meant as a quickstart basis for your own benchmarking
endeavors. If you think you have something that might be interesting to a wider audience
you are more than welcome to `Contribute`_.
